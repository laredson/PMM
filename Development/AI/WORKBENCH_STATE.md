# PMM shared implementation state

## v1.5.0.0 translation branch — 2026-09-16

Branch `v1.5.0.0-PMM-translated` starts from validated `main` commit `70d106e871099e4936dc5f81eef3e4ea15529d93`. This branch is the working line for the next PMM localization release; the discarded historical 1.4 line is not reused.

### Current translation state

`PMM/Resources/Localization/languages.json` is the complete locale inventory for v1.5. Pending/template/reserve languages remain traceable in Git but are filtered from normal runtime language resolution until enabled.

The active selector now contains five completed native labels: `English`, `Español`, `简体中文`, `हिन्दी`, and `العربية`.

Hindi (`hi`) is `enabled: true` / `status: complete`. The user's first runtime screenshot shows that Devanagari renders correctly and the visible Fix Lab layout has no obvious severe clipping. The screenshot also revealed generic dynamic English suffixes such as `0 candidate(s)`, `0 variant(s)` and `0 case backup(s)`; those are dynamic-format localization gaps to fix generically before final v1.5 release acceptance rather than missing Hindi catalog keys.

Modern Standard Arabic (`ar`) has now been completed from the previously committed partial catalog, not restarted. Its catalog follows the complete current canonical English key sequence, is marked `translationStatus: complete`, and its registry entry is now `enabled: true` / `status: complete` with `direction: rtl`. It is ready for the user's first real Windows RTL/layout test after Fetch/Pull, language selection, Apply language, and PMM restart. Release acceptance remains separate and still requires the normal localization/PowerShell/WPF checks plus the user's visual RTL review.

The experimental live-language-switch implementation remains reverted because the user observed slow startup, slow in-session changes and incorrect refresh results. PMM uses the stable behavior: selecting a language saves it, and the complete interface adopts it after PMM is restarted.

Translation workload remains conservatively scoped. Two complete 1,291-string languages per prompt was too aggressive. The default working unit is roughly 300-400 newly translated/reviewed strings, or one contained finalization/activation pass when a sufficiently complete draft already exists. Every intervention must leave a recoverable Git checkpoint and update `Development/Localization/TRANSLATION_PLAN.md` plus this file.

The backlog is prioritized by estimated **Palworld audience**, not world population alone. The detailed evidence model, ordered locale queue and intervention log live in `Development/Localization/TRANSLATION_PLAN.md`. With the early Hindi/Arabic quality targets complete for user testing, the next commercial target is Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), followed by Korean (`ko`), one language/stage at a time.

Temporary recovery artifacts used during interrupted translation work are removed once their useful state is represented in canonical files and this ledger. Git history remains the recovery source if an interrupted step must be inspected.

### v1.5 runtime identity correction

A user screenshot on the correct `v1.5.0.0-PMM-translated` checkout still showed `PMM - Palworld Manager Merger v1.3.4.1`. The checkout itself was not the problem. `Modules/Bootstrap/Start-PalModMerger.ps1` reads `Resources/Metadata/VERSION.txt` when it creates the WPF title, and that metadata file was still inherited unchanged from the 1.3.4.1 release.

The branch runtime identity is now explicitly `1.5.0.0`: `Resources/Metadata/VERSION.txt` is `1.5.0.0` and `Resources/Metadata/BUILD_ID.txt` is `PMM-v1.5.0.0-localization-dev`. This is development metadata only. No v1.5 release/tag/main merge was created, and the old 1.3.4.1 release manifest/hash inventory remains release provenance until the eventual 1.5 package is generated.

GitHub Desktop switching/fetching a branch changes the checked-out repository files; it does not itself rebuild or replace `PMM.exe`. The editable PMM UI does read the checked-out `VERSION.txt` at startup, however, so after pulling this intervention and restarting PMM from the repository checkout the window title should show `v1.5.0.0`. If it still shows 1.3.4.1 after that, the executable was launched from a different PMM folder/copy and that path must be identified before further code changes.

Every future translation intervention must update both `Development/Localization/TRANSLATION_PLAN.md` and this state record in the same branch. No v1.5 release, tag, main merge or native executable change has been made yet.

# Historical PMM 1.3.3 shared implementation state

Branch 1.3.3 starts exactly at 1.3.2 commit 3e57247f823317c85ceb71a4272b0a813f1f34fc. Current implementation: deep-analysis preview with account-aware AI routing. No public release/push requested.

## Preserved baseline

The 1.3.2 case V4 repairs, Providers collision fix, current mappings selection, long-path/reference recovery, reader 0.3 and exact historical-delta/current-layout DataTable transfer remain. Native binaries are unchanged. FasterMounts/RushRoar preserves 753 rows / 68,523 properties and all 103 current true IsUncapturable flags. See the 1.3.2 validation record for its exact cooked-data proof.

EasyBreeding/NoCollision remains Unsupported: current 29 exports versus old 28 and missing Blueprint schema. Do not reactivate the historical whole-family replacement. The Gura RC30 reporter confirmed 1.3.1 works; that is not a proven 1.3.1 regression.

Existing real cases: BreedFarm AICASE-20260912-202028-a27cf054 and Faster/Rush AICASE-20260912-202029-ea4c2ad7. Preserve their identifiers and history. Mapping104 remains local in Workspace and must not be redistributed.

## Added

- Deep analysis above Analysis plan, immutable snapshots/findings, explicit coverage, JSON/HTML, selected/new/linked cases and staged update analysis.
- Exact origin and variant handling for Nexus/GitHub; original source and selected patch preserved. New candidate-only merge output avoids changing case inputs.
- Selective 1.4.0-ReUI service/presentation/workflow separation, module catalog, idle-compatible reload, durable recovery, candidate/observation history. Original six-tab UI retained.
- Persistent App Server case conversations, scoped MCP repair sessions and durable idempotent jobs; failed attempts and local reproducible procedures retained.
- Routine AI uses Luna / low / standard explicitly. Optional authorized escalation to Terra/medium and Sol/high, detected account access, quota/model checks, API billing opt-in and manual-chat export. Model/effort acknowledgement is checked before starting a request. No silent fallback to Astra/fast. Deterministic work stays in PMM.
- UI model policy, cases and origins use sender-bound state instead of module closures that lose access to script-scoped services in PS5.1.

## Validation and boundaries

See Development/Docs/Validation/PMM_1_3_3_ANALYSIS_VALIDATION.md for executed suites, real local scan and protocol evidence. The AI-policy probe now explicitly verifies Luna/low/default; broader routing tests are offline protocol fixtures.

Full automation is not accepted. A conversation opened in the Windows desktop can retain its active writer; this installed runtime lacks the shared daemon-control adapter. Retain the same ID and pause. Game launch/world/isolation controls remain blocked until the adapter proves save/configuration/sync isolation and actual restore behavior. No Palworld launch or installed-mod modification during development.

Nexus/GitHub live downloads and update activation have not been accepted end to end. Staging/reanalysis and exact variant tests pass. Reader coverage remains partial for opaque Blueprint payloads. Static structural success is not runtime or feature-preservation proof.

The 1.4.0-ReUI branch remains preserved separately. Do not blanket-add pre-existing untracked MCP notes, InventoryProbe, SuperInventory, Development/Tools or caches. Keep Workspace, TestResults and ExternalFiles out of the public package.

Next acceptance work: supported shared Windows conversation control, supervised world/restore adapter validation expressly authorized by the user, and reader capability for the BreedFarm case. Do not launch Palworld or change the user's installed mods under the existing development authorization.

## 1.3.3 case entry hotfix

The user runs C:/Modding/palworld/1.3.3333/PMM. This copy is patched in place with a sibling backup PMM-backup-case-entry-20260912-191252. Its active UI was not closed; restart is required. The AUAT case AICASE-20260913-004810-a5411828 now includes the exact AutoUnlockAllTechnology_V1_P.pak reference at step 4. AUAT itself has not yet been rebuilt or runtime-tested.

Resolved: missing library context menu, old hardcoded window title, missing desktop Codex discovery outside task PATH, invisible case agent errors/responses, duplicated sessions on retry and ineffective case cancellation. New cases default to GPTD but do not send until requested. Existing seven paused AUAT sessions are preserved. Current behavior, validation and package receipt: Development/Docs/Validation/PMM_1_3_3_CASE_ENTRY_VALIDATION.md.

Maintain Luna low/standard routing and the no-Palworld/no-live-game-mod-change development instruction. The live connection regression queried metadata only; no inference started in this hotfix verification.

### Case entry hotfix 2: actual library row contract

The first menu regression was insufficient: it supplied synthetic rows with Path, while the production Refresh-UI omitted Path/Hash. The user's follow-up caught this. Both active and disabled display rows now preserve source Path and full Hash. Revised tests use the real library scan, disable operation and Refresh-UI, and reproduce the defect before passing 26 assertions per EN/ES after the fix. Preserve this production-row coverage; do not reintroduce hand-built display rows in the context-menu test.
